A stroke, sometimes called a brain attack, occurs when something blocks blood supply to part of the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts. 
In either cases the tissues suffer from hypoxy Ð°nd can get damaged or die off. A stroke can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death.

As stated above - there are two types of brain stroke:
- ischemic stroke
- hemorrhagic stroke
- mini stroke - transient ischemic attack(TIA)

The last one is reffered to situation where the blood flow to the brain is blocked for a short period of time and then restored(no more than 5 mins).

Depending on the affected aeria of the brain, the stoke can cause death or can alter the ability to move, speak, eat, talk, think and remember, control bowel and bladder, control emotions and other vital body functions.

But what are the risk factors?
External factors, that can be controlled:
- high blood pressure
- heart disease
- diabeted
- smoking
- birth control pills
- history of TIA's
- high red blood cell count
- high blood cholesterol and lipids
- lack of exercise 
- obesity
- smoking
- alcohol abuse
- drugs
- cardiac structural abnormalities
Factors, that cannot be controlled:
- older age
- race
- gender
- history of prior stroke
- genetics

Each year in __Bulgaria__, slightly more than 35,000 individuals experience brain strokes, and out of these cases, approximately 7,000 result in a fatal outcome for the affected individuals.
Stroke is ranked as the second leading cause of death worldwide with an annual mortality rate of about 5.5 million. Not only does the burden of stroke lie in the high mortality but the high morbidity also results in up to 50% of survivors being chronically disabled.

With that being said, it is evident that understanding and analyzing the risk factors is crucial for preventing strokes and mitigating their impact on individuals.
Let's shift our focus to the practical aspect of analyzing data and building predictive models using code. This analysis will enable us to work towards more effective stroke prevention strategies and outcomes.
